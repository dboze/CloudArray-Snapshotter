TwinStrata CloudArray snapshot script

Requirements: 
  yaml, httparty, crack, logger
  CloudArray v3.3.0 or higher
  Tested on Ruby 1.8.7

Use:
  - `gem install bundler`
  - `bundler install`
  - Rename config.yml.example to config.yml
  - add the IP or DNS name of your CloudArray appliance under 'cloudarray'
  - set the 'when' attribute to 'flush' or 'now' 
    (refer to CloudArraySnapshotAPIGuide for more information)
  - set your username and password
  - list any volumes you do not want snapshotted under 'exclusions'
  - run the script
  - make sure everything is working in snapshot.log
  - add to crontab at desired interval

Note:
The CloudArray appliance does not return an HTTP response until an action has been completed. Therefore, if the wait=flush option is used and the cache of a volume is not cleared, the script will wait for an HTTP timeout and report that the volume is in a flushing state. The snapshot will be created as soon as the cache is flushed.
